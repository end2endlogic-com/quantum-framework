=== Glossary

==== Core Concepts

**BaseModel**:: Abstract base class for all Quantum entities, providing DataDomain, audit fields, ID management, and validation hooks.

**DataDomain**:: Scoping information attached to every model (tenantId, orgRefName, ownerId, etc.) that enables multi-tenant isolation and controlled sharing.

**DomainContext**:: Runtime context representing the current execution scope (tenant, org, user, functional area/domain, action) used by repositories and security rules.

**Functional Area**:: Broad business capability grouping (e.g., Catalog, Collaboration, Identity) used for organizing models and security policies.

**Functional Domain**:: Specific entity type within a functional area (e.g., Product within Catalog, Shipment within Collaboration) used for fine-grained permissions.

**RuleContext**:: Policy evaluation engine that determines allowed actions and contributes data filters based on identity, functional area/domain, and business rules.

==== Multi-Tenancy

**Tenant**:: Logical partition representing a customer or organization in a multi-tenant system, identified by tenantId.

**Organization (Org)**:: Business unit within a tenant, identified by orgRefName, enabling sub-tenant grouping and sharing.

**Realm**:: Database or data partition, often corresponding to a MongoDB database, that can be selected per request via X-Realm header.

**Shared Domain**:: Data domain accessible across multiple tenants (e.g., public catalogs, partner directories) as opposed to tenant-isolated data.

==== Security

**Principal**:: Authenticated user identity with associated roles, tenant membership, and permissions.

**Permission Rule**:: Declarative policy that matches requests (URL, method, headers, body) and decides ALLOW/DENY with optional data filters.

**Access Resolver**:: Plugin that computes dynamic access lists (e.g., customer IDs a user can see) for use in permission filters.

**Impersonation**:: Acting as another user identity for troubleshooting or administrative purposes, controlled by scripts and realm restrictions.

==== Data and Persistence

**MorphiaRepo**:: Repository interface extending MongoDB operations with Quantum's DataDomain filtering, validation, and audit capabilities.

**EntityReference**:: Lightweight reference object containing ID, type, refName, and displayName, used for foreign keys without full object loading.

**StateGraph**:: Finite state machine definition for model fields, enforcing valid states and transitions (e.g., Order: Draft → Processing → Shipped).

**Completion Task**:: Persistent work item with status tracking, used for checklists and long-running processes with audit trails.

==== REST and APIs

**BaseResource**:: Abstract REST resource class providing consistent CRUD endpoints (find, get, list, save, update, delete) with automatic security and validation.

**Query Language**:: ANTLR-based filter syntax used across all list endpoints, permission rules, and access resolvers for consistent data querying.

**UIActions**:: List of actions a user can perform on a specific entity instance, computed based on entity state and user permissions.

**CSV Import/Export**:: Built-in endpoints for bulk data operations with validation, preview sessions, and error handling.

==== Framework Components

**ValidationInterceptor**:: Morphia interceptor that runs Jakarta Bean Validation and defaults DataDomain before persistence.

**SecurityFilter**:: JAX-RS filter that builds security context (PrincipalContext, ResourceContext) and evaluates permissions for each request.

**DataDomainResolver**:: Service that determines which DataDomain to assign to new entities based on functional area/domain policies.

**Migration**:: Versioned database schema and data changes managed by Quantum's migration framework with changeset tracking.

==== Annotations

**@FunctionalMapping**:: Class-level annotation declaring a model's functional area and domain, replacing legacy bmFunctionalArea() methods.

**@FunctionalAction**:: Method-level annotation specifying the action performed by a REST endpoint when it differs from HTTP verb defaults.

**@TrackReferences**:: Field annotation on @Reference fields that maintains back-reference sets for referential integrity checking.

**@RegisterForReflection**:: Quarkus annotation ensuring classes are available for reflection in native images.

==== External Integrations

**JWT Provider**:: Authentication module that validates JSON Web Tokens and populates security context with user identity and roles.

**OIDC Integration**:: OpenID Connect support for enterprise identity providers like Keycloak, Auth0, and AWS Cognito.

**Feature Flags**:: Configuration-driven capability toggles with targeting rules for gradual rollouts and A/B testing.

**Postmark Integration**:: Email service integration for transactional messaging with template support.
