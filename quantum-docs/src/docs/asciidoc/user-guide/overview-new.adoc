=== Overview: Building SaaS with Quantum

Quantum accelerates building multi-tenant SaaS platforms by providing secure-by-default foundations that scale from prototype to production.

==== What Quantum Solves

**Multi-tenant isolation with controlled sharing**
- Each tenant's data is isolated by default
- Selective sharing via policy rules (e.g., shared catalogs, partner directories)
- Flexible tenancy models: one-database-per-tenant or shared-database-with-filtering

**Consistent, secure APIs**
- Single BaseResource pattern for all CRUD operations
- Automatic DataDomain filtering ensures users see only authorized data
- Built-in query language works across all endpoints

**Policy-driven authorization**
- Human-readable rules define "who can do what"
- Rules contribute data filters (not just allow/deny)
- Changes take effect without code deployment

**Developer productivity**
- Minimal boilerplate: extend BaseModel and BaseResource
- Live reload in development mode
- Automatic OpenAPI documentation
- Built-in CSV import/export for all entities

==== Core Building Blocks

**Models**: Extend BaseModel for automatic multi-tenancy, validation, and audit trails

**Repositories**: Extend MorphiaRepo for MongoDB operations with security filtering

**Resources**: Extend BaseResource for consistent REST APIs with minimal code

**Security**: Pluggable authentication (JWT, OIDC) with declarative permission rules

**Query Language**: Single syntax for filtering across APIs, permissions, and reports

==== When to Use Quantum

✅ **Good fit**:
- Multi-tenant B2B SaaS platforms
- Applications requiring flexible data sharing between organizations
- Teams wanting consistent REST APIs without boilerplate
- Projects needing audit trails and compliance features

❌ **Consider alternatives**:
- Single-tenant applications
- High-frequency trading or real-time systems
- Applications with complex, non-relational data models
- Teams preferring GraphQL over REST
